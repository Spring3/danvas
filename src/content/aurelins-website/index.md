A website that I am making for my sister. It is going to be a place where she will put her portfolio work - images and 3d models. Ideally the aim was to create a really artistic place, rich with animation and UI made with taste, as well as provide an ability to render the models live on the web page.

This is a work in progress, so no link is available
