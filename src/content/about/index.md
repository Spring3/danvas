My name is **Daniyil Vasylenko**. I'm a Node.js and React developer.

I wanted to be capable of building nice products, that's why I learnt to do both - back-end and front-end parts of it.

Currently, at **Dial-Once** I build web applications using React and Redux, as well as enhance the micro-service infrastructure behind it.

To learn more about my experience, see my [CV](/about/cv)
